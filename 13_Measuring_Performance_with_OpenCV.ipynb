    "<p>• To measure the performance of your code.\n",
    "<p>• Some tips to improve the performance of your code.\n",
    "<p>• You will see these functions : cv2.getTickCount, cv2.getTickFrequency etc.\n",
    "Apart from OpenCV, Python also provides a module time which is helpful in measuring the time of execution. Another\n",
    "module profile helps to get detailed report on the code, like how much time each function in the code took, how many\n",
    "times the function was called etc. But, if you are using IPython, all these features are integrated in an user-friendly\n",

    "<p>**cv2.getTickCount** function returns the number of clock-cycles after a reference event (like the moment machine was\n",
